Chebyshev’s inequality guarantees that, for a wide class of probability distributions, no more than a certain fraction of values can be more than a certain distance from the mean.  Specifically, no more than 1/k^2 of the distribution’s values can be more than k standard deviations away from the mean (or equivalently, at least 1−1/k^2 of the distribution’s values are within k standard deviations of the mean).

In normal distributions, Chebyshev’s inequality stats that a minimum of just 75% of values must lie within two standard deviations of the mean and 89% within three standard deviations.

Pr[ \|X – E[X] \| >= a ] <= Var(X)/(aˆ2)

The weak law states that for a specified large n, the average is likely to be near μ. Thus, it leaves open the possibility that \| Xn − μ \| > ε   happens an infinite number of times, although at infrequent intervals. (Not necessarily \| Xn − μ \| ≠ 0  for all n).

The strong law shows that this almost surely will not occur. In particular, it implies that with probability 1, we have that for any ε > 0 the inequality \| X n − μ \|  < ε   holds for all large enough n.

So to the end, to answer the question here you will find the derivation of weak LLN from Chebichev inequality:

Pr( \|X – mu\| >= eps ) <= Var(X)/epsˆ(2) = roˆ2/( n * epsˆ2 )

as n-> + ∞:
lim for n -> + ∞ of A is 0.
