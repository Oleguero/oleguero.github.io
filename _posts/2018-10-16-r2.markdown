What is conditional frequency? It is nothing more then a "fair" (in the mathematical sense)
comparison between _categorical variables_. Let's take a practical example and
consider the following table.

![rel-freq-table](../assets/con_freq_table.png) 
This table represents the interests of women and men for the given activities and is an 
shows up relative frequencies for the whole table.

But maybe we want to consider just given a specific row (in this case men and women) 
we want to analyse what their interests singularly taken. So we obtain the following table
![rel-freq-table-row](../assets/con_freq_table_row.png)

Finally maybe we want to consider the column instead, and we get that table.
