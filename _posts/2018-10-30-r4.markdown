#### Boole's inequality
The Boole's inequality states that for any finite set of events, the probability
that one event happens is at non-greater than the sum of probabilities of single
events.
Formally

Now we can analyse the probability of the union of two or more events.
Let's see the two event case:

the substraction of the intersaction is due to the fact you have to delete the
redundant elements as shown in figure below, it's clear that we have to delete 
the gray part.

for three sets the things goes a little trickier and we get

the point of the addiction of the intersaction between the three sets is that we substract all the intersaction pairing sets, so we substract also the elements that are
in the intersaction that instead we want in, so we add them back.


#### Sampling distribution
The sampling distribution of the mean does not exist. It is the distribution of the means we would get if we took infinite numbers of samples of the same size as our sample. We do not know the mean or the spread of this distribution, but we can use information from our sample, and from the Central Limit Theorem to have a fair idea of what the sampling distribution of the mean looks and acts like. The mean of the sampling distribution is best estimated with the sample mean, and is a good estimate of the population mean. The spread of the sampling distribution is related to the spread of the sample, and the size of the sample. We estimate the spread of the sampling distribution to be the standard deviation of the population divided by the square-root of the sample size. But because the standard deviation of the population is unknown, we use the standard deviation of the sample instead.
